Formatting Strings
Set the variable called first  to your first name.

Set the variable called last  to your last name.

Then set the variable called formatted  to a new string that interpolates both values (from the first and last variables) using f-strings or the .format()  method.  Make sure you follow this exact pattern for the new string that you store to the formatted variable (pay attention to capital/lowercase letters, spaces, commas, etc):

"First Name: Colt, Last Name: Steele"



So for this you can do this example:

first = "dave"
last = "winkler"
formatted = f"First Name: {first}, Last Name: {last}"


print(f"First Name: {first}, Last Name: {last}")


This will result in:

First Name: dave, Last Name: winkler
