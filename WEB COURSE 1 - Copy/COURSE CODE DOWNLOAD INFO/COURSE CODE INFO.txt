IMPORTANT REMINDER: How To Find And Download Course Code
The available files and resources for lectures in each section can be found and downloaded under the 'Resources' menu in the first lecture of that specific section.

Colt talks about this in the lecture named 'Accessing Course Code & Slides' (in Section 1), please review that video lecture here: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/lecture/22587518

We are adding this reminder here because it comes up as a frequent question for the 'Photo Blog CodeAlong' coming up next, where you need to download some starter code before following the exercise videos.

As mentioned above, each section will have its downloadable resources in the resources menu of the first lecture of the section, if any are available. Remember this and keep it noted for any upcoming sections in the course as well.

So, for example, in this particular section (Section 9), the downloadable code is in the resources of the first lecture of the section, as seen in the screenshot here:


In the ZIP file, you can find the starter and solution code for the 'Photo Blog CodeAlong' exercise as well, which also includes the necessary image links to complete this exercise ('PhotoSite' folder in the downloadable ZIP resource file).

Additional general notes about the downloaded course code files:

The downloaded code is usually in a ZIP file which you can then unpack and extract the contents from it.

Make sure that you do not access or use the '__MACOSX' system folder in any of the downloaded ZIP files in the course, but rather the other folder with the actual code files, usually present just next to it in the downloaded course code ZIP file.

If you need any help with it, you can reach out on the course Q&A boards.
