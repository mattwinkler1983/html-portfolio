 # Set the message variable equal to any string containing a new-line escape sequence
message = "Hello \n goodbye"
 
 
# Add a string to the mountains variable that when printed results in: /\/\/\
# You will need to use an escape sequence more than once!
mountains = "/\\/\\/\\"
 
 
# Set the quotation variable to any string that contains an escaped double quotation mark
 
quotation = "My cat said \"meow\""




To include a backslash (\) in a string in Python, you need to escape it by using another backslash (\\). Here's an example:


# Example of a string with a backslash

string_with_backslash = "This is a backslash: \\"

print(string_with_backslash)

This will output:


Copy the code
This is a backslash: \
Alternatively, you can use a raw string by prefixing the string with an r, which treats backslashes as literal characters:


Copy the code
# Using a raw string
raw_string = r"This is a backslash: \"
print(raw_string)
This will also output:


Copy the code
This is a backslash: \
Both methods work depending on your preference or the context of your code.
