Objective: 

String Concatenation Exercise
Set the variable called greeting  to some greeting, e.g. "hello".

Set the variable called name  to some name, e.g. "Heisenberg".

Then set the variable called greet_name  so that it concatenates greeting , name , and a space " " between them.


SOLUTION:

greeting = "hello"
name = "Heisenberg"
greet_name = greeting + " " + name




My solution was:

greeting = "hello"
name = "Dave"
greet_name = greeting + " " + name

Concatenation is combinging multipe strings together.  In python you can do this simply with the "+" operator.  
example: str_one = "your"
        str_two - "face"
        str_three = str_one + " " + str_two # your face
        so when you say print(str_three) in python you would get:
        your face


+=:  


The += operator in Python is a shorthand for adding a value to a variable and then assigning the result back to that variable. It is commonly referred to as an augmented assignment operator.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

Example:

Copy the code
x = 5
x += 3  # Equivalent to x = x + 3
print(x)  # Output: 8

you can do this with names:
name = "dave"
name += " winkler"
print(name)   This will show dave winkler


You can do this with numbers:

people = 99
people += 1
print(people)   This will show 100.  

people = 100
people -=10
print(people)  This will show 90.
you can do multiplier *.  subtraction.  addition. division.  There are others.
