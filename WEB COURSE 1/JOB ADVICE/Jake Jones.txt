Most of our web work at Carvana runs on React with TypeScript, so alongside polishing your HTML /CSS skills I’d suggest tackling a small React + TS project. Aim for a single-page app that’s mobile-friendly, quick to load, keyboard-accessible, and pulls a bit of live data—weather, movie listings, whatever grabs you—so you get hands-on practice with state, fetch calls, and a touch of testing.
While you’re at it, finish the Civil War page and give both projects a tidy home on GitHub. Add a short README for each that explains the problem you solved, the design choices you made, and how you checked performance and accessibility. A little storytelling around your work often carries as much weight as the code itself.
When those projects are live, send over the links plus a brief note on the main lessons you picked up—happy to look everything over whenever you’re done. With that portfolio in hand you’ll be ready to chase titles like Front-End Engineer I or UI Engineer, roles that typically start in the mid-80s to low-100s here in Phoenix. By the way, how comfortable are you with visual-design tools like Figma? Even a basic grasp of UI layout and component libraries can really set you apart.

Thanks for all your advice!  i am not familiar with Figma.  But I will search Udemy for a class on it and assign it.  I'll check out a readme on github and see what i can do.
