CSS classes and elements: defining the look and feel of web pages
In CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), elements and classes are fundamental concepts used to select and apply styles to parts of an HTML document. 
Elements
An HTML element represents a distinct component within a web page, such as a paragraph (<p>), a heading (<h1>), a division (<div>), or an image (<img>). In CSS, an element selector directly targets all instances of a particular HTML element based on its tag name. 
css
p {
  color: black;
  font-size: 16px;
}
This CSS rule styles all <p> elements on a page with black text and a font size of 16 pixels. 
Classes
A CSS class is a reusable set of style rules applied to one or more HTML elements that have the same class attribute value. Classes offer greater flexibility than element selectors because you can define a specific style and then apply it to multiple elements, regardless of their tag name. 
To use a class, you add the class attribute to the HTML element's opening tag, assigning it a chosen class name. In CSS, you select a class by using a period (.) followed by the class name. 
html
<p class="my-class">This is a paragraph with a specific style.</p>
css
.my-class {
  color: #dedede;
  font-size: 12px;
  font-style: italic;
}
