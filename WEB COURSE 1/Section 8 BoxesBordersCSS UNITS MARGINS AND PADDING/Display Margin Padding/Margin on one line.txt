Margin - Individual Sides
CSS has properties for specifying the margin for each side of an element:

margin-top
margin-right
margin-bottom
margin-left
All the margin properties can have the following values:

auto - the browser calculates the margin
length - specifies a margin in px, pt, cm, etc.
% - specifies a margin in % of the width of the containing element
inherit - specifies that the margin should be inherited from the parent element
Tip: Negative values are allowed.

Example
Set different margins for all four sides of a <p> element:

p {
  margin-top: 100px;
  margin-bottom: 100px;
  margin-right: 150px;
  margin-left: 80px;
}


Or you can set it all on one line:  

Margin - Shorthand Property
To shorten the code, it is possible to specify all the margin properties in one property.

The margin property is a shorthand property for the following individual margin properties:

margin-top
margin-right
margin-bottom
margin-left
So, here is how it works:

If the margin property has four values:

margin: 25px 50px 75px 100px;

In this example, 

top margin is 25px
right margin is 50px
bottom margin is 75px
left margin is 100px

If you put in a value such as:
The auto value puts the element to the center within its container.
