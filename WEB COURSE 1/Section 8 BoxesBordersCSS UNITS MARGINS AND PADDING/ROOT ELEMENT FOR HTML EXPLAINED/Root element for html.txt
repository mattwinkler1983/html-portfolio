Attributes and Usage

The <html> element can include several attributes, such as lang, version, and xmlns. The lang attribute specifies the language of the document, which is crucial for accessibility and proper pronunciation by screen readers. The version attribute indicates the version of the HTML Document Type Definition, although it is often redundant. The xmlns attribute specifies the XML Namespace of the document, which is required for documents parsed with XML parsers
